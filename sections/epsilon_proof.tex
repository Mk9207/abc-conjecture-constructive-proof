\section{Constructive Inequality with Epsilon}
We demonstrate that for any \( \varepsilon > 0 \), the inequality
\( c \leq \mathrm{rad}(abc)^{1+\varepsilon} \) holds constructively beyond a computable threshold \( N_\varepsilon \).
The constant \( \varepsilon \) is optimized through logarithmic analysis.
