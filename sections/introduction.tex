\section{Introduction}
The ABC Conjecture is one of the central problems in number theory.
We aim to constructively prove that for all coprime positive integers \( a, b, c \) such that \( a + b = c \),
the inequality \( c < \mathrm{rad}(abc)^{1+\varepsilon} \) holds for all sufficiently large \( abc \),
with only finitely many exceptions.
